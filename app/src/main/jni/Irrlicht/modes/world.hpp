/** 
 *  \brief base class for all game modes
 *  This class is responsible for running the actual race. A world is created
 *  by the race manager on the start of each race (so a new world is created
 *  for each race of a Grand Prix). It creates the 
 *  physics, loads the track, creates all karts, and initialises the race
 *  specific managers (ItemManager, ProjectilManager, highscores, ...).
 *  It uses the information from the race manager to get information like
 *  what and how many karts, track to load etc. This class does not really
 *  know about Grand Prixs, a GP is created
 *  It maintains the race clock, and updates all karts, herings etc. during
 *  the race.
 *  Special game modes (e.g. follow the leader) are currently integrated in
 *  this world, see e.g. updateRaceStatus where the world clock behaviour
 *  is handled differently to create the count down.
 *  \todo The different game modes should be implemented more cleanly (instead
 *        of being handled by if statements all over the place). E.g. world
 *        could become a base class, from which the following classes are
 *        created:
 *        - LapCountingWorld:World           Adds lap counting to the world
 *        - TimeTrialWorld:LapCountingWorld  Creates a world for time trial
 *                                           mode.
 *        - CrazyRaceWorld:LapCountingWorld  Creates a world for crazy race
 *                                           (currently called quick race).
 *        - FollowLeaderWorld:World          Creates the follow the leader mode.
 *        - TagWorld:World                   Multi-player 'tag' like game.
 *  Of course, other designs are possible (e.g. a mode-specific object could
 *  be passed into the world constructor, and world just calls functions in
 *  this object.
 *  \todo The handling of the FollowTheLeader mode should probably be changed
 *        as well. Currently the leader kart is a normal AI kart (so it is 
 *        included in the number of karts selected), and this causes some 
 *        unnecessary handling of special cases everywhere (e.g. score 
 *        counting will subtract one from the rank, since the kart on position
 *        1 is the leader and does not score points, and the kart on position 
 *        2 should get the points for a kart on position 1 etc). With a 
 *        special world for the FTL mode this could be handled better: 
 *        creating a special kart type (see RaceManager::KartType), scoring
 *        would be done in the mode specific world (instead of in the
 *        RaceManager).
